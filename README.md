# Low-Density Parity Check Codes in 5G NR Standard

## Overview
This project implements a Low-Density Parity Check (LDPC) decoder in MATLAB for the 5G New Radio (NR) standard. The LDPC codes are a type of error-correcting code that offers high performance for communication systems, particularly in scenarios with noise, such as Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) channels. This was a group project completed under the course CT 216 - Introduction to Communication Systems, and all results gained are presented in a PowerPoint presentation along with the theory behind it.

## Objectives
- Develop a robust LDPC decoder to improve signal integrity in 5G NR communication.
- Implement minsum decoding algorithms to efficiently encode and decode messages.
- Visualize performance metrics for different base graphs to analyze decoder performance.

## Key Features
- **Error Correction**: Effectively mitigates signal degradation due to noise in communication channels.
- **High Performance**: Utilizes minsum decoding algorithms to ensure fast and efficient decoding processes.
- **Data Visualization**: MATLAB's plotting capabilities are leveraged to provide insightful visualizations of performance metrics for comparative analysis.

## Technologies Used
- **MATLAB**: The primary programming language used for the implementation.
- **Plotting Functions**: MATLABâ€™s built-in functions for data visualization to analyze the performance of different LDPC base graphs.

## Installation
Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Manthan-D-Parmar/LDPC-Codes-in-5G-NR-Standard.git
```
## Installation
Open the project in MATLAB. Run the main script to execute the LDPC decoding process.

## Usage
To use the LDPC decoder:

- Set the input parameters for your messages and channel conditions in the main script.
- Execute the script to encode, decode, and visualize the results.
